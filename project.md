Here are a few of my notable projects. Click on each project to learn more:

### [Portfolio Website](https://www.abhay-cs.github.io)
A minimal and responsive personal portfolio website built to showcase my skills, projects, and contact information. The website features a sidebar for easy navigation between different sections such as About Me, Skills, and Contact. 

One of the unique aspects of this project is that I used **Markdown files** to store and manage the content of each section, which is then dynamically rendered into **HTML** using JavaScript and the **Showdown.js** library. This approach makes it easier to update and maintain the content of the website in the future without having to edit the HTML files directly. By simply editing the Markdown files, I can instantly reflect changes on the website.

**Technologies**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Showdown.js (Markdown to HTML converter)
